Hello, I'm Spencer! Recently, I completed my Bachelor's in Business Administration and am now venturing into the world of data analytics and data science. My previous roles in eKYC Solutions and AML Compliance have given me a solid foundation in handling data, and I have a particular affinity for working with data visualization and database tools. Specializing in Business and Economic Geography has allowed me to build a portfolio in ArcGIS Pro, which you can explore right here on my site. 

A couple projects I'm currently engaged in include:
  * Exploring traditional and quantitative theories and strategies in financial markets
  * Developing Skills in: 
    * Oracle MySQL
    * Microsoft Power BI
    * Tableau

In my downtime, I take pleasure in an assortment of hobbies, including but not limited to: 
  * Food Gastronomy
  * Fishing
  * Delving into World War II History 

If you're interested in collaborating or simply want to get in touch, please contact me.
